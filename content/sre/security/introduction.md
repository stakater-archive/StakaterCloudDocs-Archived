# Overview of security threats for your cluster

You can use built-in security features in Stakater Agility Platform for risk analysis and security protection. These features help you to protect your cluster infrastructure and network communication, isolate your compute resources, and ensure security compliance across your infrastructure components and container deployments.

To protect your cluster from being compromised, you must understand potential security threats for your cluster and what you can do to reduce the exposure to vulnerabilities.

Cloud security and the protection of your systems, infrastructure, and data against attacks became very important over the last couple of years as companies continue to move their workloads into the public cloud. A cluster consists of several components that each can put your environment at risk for malicious attacks. To protect your cluster against these security threats, you must make sure that you apply the latest Red Hat OpenShift security features and updates in all cluster components.

These components include:

- OpenShift API Server and ETCD
- OpenShift Console
- Worker nodes
- Network
- Persistent storage
- Container images and registry
- Container isolation and security
- Personal information
