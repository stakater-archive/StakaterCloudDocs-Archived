# Getting Support

We provide support to the customers via our [Service Desk Portal](https://stakater-cloud.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals). You can create Bugs, suggest for improvements/feature request or ask for technical support by creating support tickets on the portal. Users with access only will be able to create support tickets.

## Add Users to Support Portal
