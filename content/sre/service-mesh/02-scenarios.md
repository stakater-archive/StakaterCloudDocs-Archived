## Scenarios

Few list of scenarios:

1. **Advanced Route Rules:** Learn about Istio’s smart routing, access control, load balancing, and rate limiting.
2. **Fault injection with Istio:** Understand failure scenarios of distributed computing by working through HTTP errors and network delays, applying chaos engineering to repair the environment.
3. **Circuit Breaker with Istio:** Install Siege to stress test URLs, fail fast, and achieve the ultimate back-end resilience using retries, circuit breaker, and pool ejection.
4. **Egress with Istio:** Use Egress routes to apply rules to how internal services interact with external APIs and services.
5. **Observing Istio with Kiali:** Explore Kiali’s ability to give a big picture of the mesh and show the whole flow of requests and data.
6. **Mutual TLS with Istio:** Create an Istio Gateway and VirtualService, then get a closer look at mutual TLS (mTLS) to learn its settings.
